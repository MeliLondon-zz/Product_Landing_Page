        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>Well it's actually just me! I'm Melissa and I'm passionate about food, especially baking. I'm fascinated by amazing cakes and find decoration brilliant. There are so many different things that can be done with few ingredients and it can turn a simple chocolate cake into a marvel that is almost too beautiful to be eaten (but only almost &#128516)<br></p>
        <p>What I'm offering is to share with you my passion and help dig into your imagination to get more creative with baking, wherever it is for a quick catch-up at home with friends &#127850 or a big birthday party &#127874</p>
